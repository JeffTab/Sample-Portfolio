            <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Hello! I am currently a student at a Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I am also
                currently an Amazon warehouse
                employee. I get to play with the robots, but mostly I pick stuff up that fell on the floor. What a job!
                <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have had a myriad of other jobs,vertical carousel maintenance worker,
                home health aide, toll booth operator, customer service associate, library assistant, limousine driver,
                and nearly every job in a supermarket. I also have an associates degree in general science. Talk about
                lack of common ground!
                <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In a similar spirit, I have decided to tackle something new. Coding! I
                look forward to learning all sorts of things and building a real portfolio!
