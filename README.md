#   Sample Portfolio

##  Description

This is a sample of what my portfolio *could* look like.  Will it?  Who knows!  It's a bit early to tell.  Regardless, it probably won't be done quite like this.  This only uses html and css.  Hopefully by the time I am ready to make a portfolio for the world to see, it will include javascript and other things that I don't even know about yet.  And maybe it won't include contractions, feels very informal.

Anyway, this is it, my sample portfolio.  This was made for my Rutgers Coding Bootcamp week one homework assignment.  I made this, as I said, using html and css.   This is a project to test out how well I learned the basics of html and css.  I feel like it specifically challenged my understanding of boxes.  

**BOXES!** So many dang boxes.  And yet, I know, it is a nominal amount compared to what is to come.  Boxes can be in boxes and have borders and margins and padding and even stuff inside them.  I had previously thought they were just for Amazon items and cats.

I imagine this will never really get looked at.  I understand you're looking at it, but that'll be it.  Even if it is my first project, it is not my first repository and will most likely be overlooked by anyone snooping around my github to see how I've progressed. 

In conclusion (learned that in college), I am very proud of this project.  I am a little disappointed that I can't figure out how to get the border under the h2 header to not touch the sides.  I can imagine how to fix it in my head, but when I try it breaks other areas.  It makes me want to burn it all down a third time and start over.  I am also disappointed with how much of a mess the css page is.  There is probably a lot of redundancy and I tried to remove some by seeing what wasn't being used when I checked page inspections.  But that is a time consuming process and so was burning it all down to start again.  Which I did.  Twice.  No time left for housekeeping.  I'll do it better next time.  The conclusion isn't supposed to be the longest section. I'll work on that too.

## Table of contents, Installation, Usage, Credits, License

It's all right here.  Nothing to install.  Use by looking, reading, and clicking.  Credit goes to the homework instructions, class examples, and further examples provided by the instructor.  Anyone is free to use my code in anyway they choose.  While I hope they wouldn't choose to use it to cheat, I'd be flattered if they did.
